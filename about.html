<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented Software QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both manual and automation testing. During my internship at BusyQA Consulting, I developed and executed comprehensive software test plans, including functional tests and automated test scripts. My experience in defect management using Jira has been crucial in ensuring that software quality consistently meets client expectations.</p>

<p>I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from the University of Bradford and have completed graduate coursework in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Manitoba. Additionally, I have undergone professional training in Software Testing, where I enhanced my technical skills in tools like Selenium Webdriver, Postman, and SQL databases.</p>

<p>My strengths include excellent presentation skills, strong analytical abilities, and effective communication. I thrive in collaborative environments, actively participating in Agile Scrum processes such as daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. My commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions drives me to continuously learn and grow, as reflected in my ongoing pursuit of certifications like the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level.</p>
